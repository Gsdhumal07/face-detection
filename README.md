# Technology Used

⮚ We are using our core platform as python which is one of the best and easiest programming languages.

⮚ We used supporting editors such as PyCharm. It is one of the best editors for most of the programming processes.

## Open CV: This is a library used for image recognition, image processing and video capture. Thus, the main function of the 
system i.e., face detection is carried out using this library.
⮚ Pillow: This module collectively helps in making GUI. The interface that we see on running the program is built with help 
of this module.
⮚ Face-recognition: This module is mainly used to detect the various kinds of faces. This module compares and identifies the 
faces using in-built python libraries.
⮚ Wheel: It allow for faster installation in the package distribution process. Whenever we install anything in python wheel 
makes its faster and efficient.
⮚ Dlib: This machine learning package is used to detect the faces. It functions same as that of OpenCV and helps in image 
processing.
⮚ NumPy: This module is used for working in domain of linear algebra, Fourier transformations and matrices. It also helps in 
working with multi-directional arrays.
⮚ os: This is a basic module used for interacting with operating system. It simply connects the user and computer and thus, 
conveys our commands to computer on which results are displayed.
⮚ harrcascade: This is another element used for face detection process. It is used for training of positive and negative images 
which plays major role in face differentiating process.
⮚ detectMultiScale: When any face is detected in the image provided to system or in the webcam, we see a rectangle around 
the face. Thus, this module returns that rectangle with coordinates(x,y,w,h).
